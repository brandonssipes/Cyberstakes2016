Solving Ciphers!!! yeah!

<br>
So they give you this file and it obviously isn't readable because it has been manipulated somehow.  <br>
<br> Well you can either be smart and know what to do from the title. I wasn't that smart (although in hindsight...)
<br> Anyway given a ciphertext and no knowlegde of how it was ciphered can be a problem.<br> There is definitely a list of ciphers you
should go through considering: Caesar, Vigenere, etc...  <br> OR <br> you could plug it in to the handy dandy good ol' <strong><a href="http://quipqiup.com/index.php">quipqiup</a></strong>
<br> now if you just copy a could lines we can see what quipqiup does with it. <br> Ahh quipqiup you did it again.  This tells us both 
the key and that it was an AtBash cipher (hence the name...)
