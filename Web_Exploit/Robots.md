We are given a link to a basic web page and simply told to steal the flag.  
Well a quick look at the hint tells us:
>How could you hide a flag from a robot?

The way you hide things on the internet from robots is a thing called a "robots.txt" file.
This is just something to know that most webpages have and is something that you <strong>should know</strong>
It doesn't always have important information and usually in CTFs it will be usless (excpet when a problem expects that you know it.)
However, it my sometimes be worth a quick check just becuase.
What is a robots.txt file? 
Great question.

The robots.txt file is a standard page that tells webcrawlers like Googlebot if they should access a file or not.

Your standard robots.txt file will probably look something like:
<br>
User-agent: *
<br>
Disallow: /

Or whatever...
